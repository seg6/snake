# Snake

This is an implementation of the Snake game written entirely in Structured Text! It was pretty fun to work on this as I was still quite new to the world of PLCs and ST at the time.

I got the idea to work on this when I realized that I could use a grid of HMI lamps as a canvas to draw things on. Before tackling this Snake implementation a couple of years ago, I made two other demos:

- [Bad Apple on a Grid of HMI Lamps!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/1j2fjhe/bad_apple_on_a_grid_of_hmi_lamps/)
- [A fully functional raytracer being rendered on an HMI](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/vune11/a_fully_functional_raytracer_being_rendered_on_an/)
